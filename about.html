            <p>

                NurtureWild is a CIC established in November 2021 due to a growing
                need to link people to nature, and a lack of services that support mental health and wellbeing. The
                Covid
                19 pandemic enhanced a lot of these issues, so we decided to take
                action.
                <br><br>
                At NurtureWild, our vision is to tackle the issues that affect individuals, communities and the natural
                environment. We are determined to address these through facilitating connection to the natural world,
                integrating the sharing and learning of land skills and heritage crafts with wellbeing to motivate
                reciprocal work which benefits people and their environment.
                <br><br>
                We are working on our local community in the Bristol, South Gloucestershire and
                Gloucestershire areas.
